### Part 1: The Comprehensive User Journey

The U-Dry experience is a four-stage process: Discovery, Rental, Usage, and Return.

**1. Account Setup & Wallet Management**
- **App Availability:** The U-Dry app is available for download on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store for Android.
- **Registration:** Users can sign up for a new account or sign in using their email address. The app is rated for ages 4+.
- **Deposit Requirement:** To begin renting, your account wallet must have a minimum deposit of HK$100.
- **Wallet Features:** Within the "Account Wallet," users can manage their balance and use the "Request Deposit" feature to refund their deposit.
- **Transaction Latency:** If a deposit or transaction does not appear immediately, it may be due to app latency. Users should restart the app to refresh the data.

**2. Finding and Renting an Umbrella**
- **Locate a Station:** Use the interactive map on the home screen to find nearby stations throughout the city.
- **Check Availability:** The map displays the exact number of umbrellas available at each stall in real-time.
- **Scanning:** Tap the "Scan & Rent" button and point the camera at the QR code on the machine.
- **Troubleshooting:** If the code won't scan, close and reopen the app to reset the camera.
- **Technical Connection:** Once the app identifies the stall, tap "Continue to Connection."
- **Machine Pairing:** A system pop-up will appear. You must manually select the correct machine code (e.g., "CDKJ") to unlock the umbrella.
- **Physical Removal (The Rail System):** IMPORTANT: Never pull the umbrella downwards. Once the machine is unlocked, slide the umbrella along the rail until it reaches the "exit" opening to remove it.
- **If the machine times out** before you can remove it, please retry the rental process in the app.

**3. Usage & Pricing**
- **Hourly Rate:** HK$5 per hour.
- **Daily Maximum:** Charges are capped at HK$25 per 24-hour period.
- **Return Deadline:** Umbrellas must be returned within 72 hours (3 days). Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of the HK$100 deposit.
- **Live Tracking:** The app features an "Active Rental" timer so users can track usage in real-time.

**4. Returning the Umbrella**
- **Flexible Returns:** Umbrellas can be returned to any U-Dry station with an available empty slot.
- **Return Steps:**
    1. Scan the machine's QR code and select "Continue to Return."
    2. Select the machine code (e.g., "CDKJ") in the pop-up to connect.
    3. Slide the umbrella completely into the rail.
    4. Verify that the "Return Confirmed" message appears to end the rental session.
- **Timer Troubleshooting:** If the timer continues to run after a return:
    1. Check if the umbrella is slotted into the rail completely.
    2. Restart the app.
    3. If the timer is still active, contact U-Dry support immediately.
    4. **A note on billing:** If you cannot reach support immediately, please don't worry. We will investigate any timer discrepancies and ensure you are only charged the correct amount for your rental.
